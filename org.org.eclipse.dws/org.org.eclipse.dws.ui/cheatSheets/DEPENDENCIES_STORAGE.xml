   <intro>
      <description>
         If you import projects using former versions of DWS, you may have issues related to the DEPENDENCIES_STORAGE variable not being found anymore.<br/><br/>
In fact the DEPENDENCIES_STORAGE has been renamed <b>M2_REPO</b> as a default as DWS only supports Maven for now (this allows to keep a coherence between this and maven generated classpath entries).<br/>
The few following steps will create the new variable and update the declaration of the former DEPENDENCIES_STORAGE with this new variable.<br/>
You may also go into the preferences and change the variable back to DEPENDENCIES_STORAGE.
